# Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX
This Solidity Program is a simple program that demonstrates a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Description
The program is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. It contains three functions: requireStatement, assertStatement, and revertStatement. Each function takes a number as input and checks a condition using one of the three statements. If the condition is not satisfied, the contract behaves differently: require() reverts the transaction with an error message, assert() throws an exception and reverts the transaction, and revert() explicitly reverts the transaction with an error message.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing program
1. Create a file on Remix
  * To start building a smart contract, click on New File and name it MyToken.sol.

2. Upload a pre-built smart contract into the IDE
  * Copy and paste the Smart Contract code provided into the newly created MyToken.sol file.

3. Compile the smart contract
   1. Go to the Solidity Compiler tab (below the search button).
   2. Select compiler version to 0.5.10.
   3. Now, compile MyToken.sol.
   4. After successful compilation, it will show a green tick mark on the Compiler tab button.

4. Deploy the smart contract
 * Once MetaMask is connected to Remix, the Deploy transaction would generate another MetaMask popup that requires transaction confirmation. Simply confirm the transaction!

5. Verify the smart contract.
